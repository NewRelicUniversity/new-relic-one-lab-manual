2. Click _Add to Dashboard_ in the lower-right corner and add the chart to a new dashboard.
3. Create a bar chart that shows the 10 cities with the most sessions over the past 24 hours. Add the chart to the dashboard you created in Step 2. _Hint:_ <span>Use <em>Facet by</em> to group sessions by city.</span>
4. Create a line chart showing the average page load time (duration) for the Pet Clinic application over the past hour. Add the chart to your dashboard.
5. Create a pie chart showing the number of web transaction errors in the Pet Clinic application over the past 7 days, grouped by transaction name. Add the chart to your dashboard.
